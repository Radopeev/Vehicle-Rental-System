Steps for making this project
1) I created enum class for the differente types of vehicles
2) Continued with a abstact class Vehicle which collects all common vehicle parts
3) Made three diffrent successor class : Motorcycle,CargoVan and Car which all add new data members
4) Made the class RentCalculator has one public method that takes vehicle, start date, end date and return date and calculates the rental cost given the conditions in the task.
   This class has many private methods to separate the different logic to provide better abstraction.
